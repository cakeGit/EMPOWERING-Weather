Grey outside, but your vibe’s still sparkling.
Overcast lighting = free studio lighting
Cloudy, but keeping your outlook clear ✨.
Sky’s moody, but you dont have to be.
Cloud cover: 100%. Confidence: 1000%.
The sky is sad today, maybe ask it to cheer up.
Cloudy, like your ex’s excuses.
Cloudy day, cause you been smoking ALL your opps.
The clouds are like your deadlines, numerous.
Grey outside, but your glow is untouched.
Sky: Grey, Town: Red with your opps
Maybe today isn't the day to procrastinate,
Is this london?
The clouds are high in the sky but you’ll still soar above ✨.
Is today a roblox day?
Blanket in the sky, blanket in your bed.

Cold outside, but your energyâ€™s sizzling.
Freezing, like your last situationshipâ€™s dms ðŸ’”
Cold, but your selfies remain straight fire.
Weatherâ€™s icy, like your ex.
Frozen outside, but inside your aura is still warm.
Temperature: frosty. Mood: unbothered ðŸ™Œ.
Your situationshipâ€™s colder than this weather, somehow.
Cold air, but your glow melts everything.
Cold outside, but your vibeâ€™s untouchable.
Today's the day for doomscrolling
It's like freeze tagâ€¦ without the tag
Ice queen energy today,
Still hotter than anyone sliding into your DMs - oo, burn.

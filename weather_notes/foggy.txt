Can’t see a thing, but I can still feel your aura.
Visibility 0%, but your energy is crystal clear.
Grey skies, like your ex’s personality… dull.
Fog rolling in, but your glow’s the main event.
Misty vibes, but at least you’re not broke like your opps.
Foggy AF, like your thoughts when doomscrolling.
Visibility low, confidence high… stay you.
Fog hiding the streets, but not your shine.
Misty morning, just keep sipping your tea.
Foggy vibes… you’re the only thing anyone’s noticing.
The fog is the only thing thicker than your ex's skull.

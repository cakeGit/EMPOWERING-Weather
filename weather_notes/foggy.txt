Fog’s thick today, mate… kinda like your opps’ excuses.
Oi, can’t see a thing, but your vibe’s loud as hell.
Fog creeping in, still hotter than anyone sliding into your DMs.
Sky hiding, like your ghoster tryna make a comeback.
Misty streets, like that group chat you’re overthinking.
Visibility 0%, but you’re crystal clear.
Mate, foggy mornings call for hoodie energy… which you’ve got in spades.
Fog outside, but your aura’s untouchable.
Grey skies, like your ex’s personality… dull.
Fog rolling in, but your glow’s the main event.
Misty vibes, but at least you’re not broke like your opps.
Fog’s giving “confused world” but you’re the only icon.
Oi, the fog’s thick, but your mood’s thicker.
Foggy AF, like your thoughts when doomscrolling.
Visibility low, confidence high… classic you.
Fog hiding the streets, but not your shine.
Grey haze, like your situationship texts… tragic.
Fog creeping, me lowkey jealous of your calm energy.
Misty morning, you sipping tea while opps panic.
Foggy vibes, mate… you’re the only thing anyone’s noticing.

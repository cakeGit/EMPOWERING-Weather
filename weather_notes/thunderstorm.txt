Thunder cracking, but your aura louder.
Storm pounding, coffee safe… mostly.
Lightning flash like the memories of your ex at night 💔🥀
Storm raging, opps panicking, you thriving.
Clouds shouting, shoes soaked, vibes intact.
Storm wild, hair tragic, aura peak.
Storm strong, but your confidence stronger.
Storm pounding, aura untouchable.
Lightning strikes: opps weak, you peak.
Storm big, but ur aura bigger stay strong queen ❤️
The storm can't steal your show.
The clouds sound like they're keeping your rent down.

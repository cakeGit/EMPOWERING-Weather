Snow falling, but your aura hotter than the boiler.
Streets icy, coffee safe… barely.
Snow’s cute, like your text game… weak, lol.
Slushy streets, but you walking main character energy.
Snow everywhere, opps slipping… you thriving.
Boots wet, hair tragic… vibes intact.
Snow chaotic, like that situationship you ghosted.
White streets, but your aura shining brighter.
Snow piling, friends whining, you laughing.
Cold chaos, like ex regretting… too late.
Snow falling, but your drip untouched.
Pavements icy, you walking like royalty.
Snow AF, still stealing scenes.
Frost biting, coffee safe, aura peak.
Snow wild, opps panicking, you calm.
Flakes everywhere, vibe unmatched.
Snow heavy, like deadlines you ignored… classic you.
Slush everywhere, shoes soaked, still iconic.
Snow falling, main character energy louder.
Cold streets, aura hotter… stay shining queen <3

Sun’s out and it’s wild… your opps still looking basic.
Hot AF, but your vibe is hotter, obviously.
Mate, streets are melting, but your drip’s untouched.
Sun screaming, like that group chat blowing up… you scrolling, unbothered.
Oi, heat’s mad, but your confidence hotter.
Sweat dripping, but you’re still main character energy.
Hot enough to roast your opps
Sun blazing, opps still weak.
Oi, heatwave vibes, but your aura peak summer.
Hot streets, you walking like “who made this world for me?”
Sun high, like your standards… untouchable.
Mate, even the ice cream’s jealous of your cool.
Heat outside, but your energy peak.
Sweat rolling, but your hair stays legendary.
Hot AF, coffee melting, vibes intact.
Sun blazing, like your ex’s regrets… lol.
Heat’s heavy, but your drip heavier.
Hot streets, your aura untouchable.
Mate, blazing day, you laughing at everyone losing it.
Sun mad, you madder… main character move.

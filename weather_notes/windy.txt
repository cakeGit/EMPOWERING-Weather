Weather: windy, hair: everywhere.
Cold wind, but your vibe’s hotter than his texts.
Wind still whipping, like that group chat chaos.
Gusty, but your drip stays untouched.
Wind strong, like your main character energy.
Wind messing up your vibe, but you don’t care - boss energy.
Blustery vibes, but your glow doesn’t falter.
Gusty AF, but your coffee’s staying in your cup.
Wind sideways, but your confidence upright.
Windy AF, but you’re still pulling main character energy.
Winds chaotic… but you’re still the headline act.
The wind wont be the only thing spilling the tea.
